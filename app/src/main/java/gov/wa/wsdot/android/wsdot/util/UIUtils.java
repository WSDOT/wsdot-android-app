     * key will still work, however, it will open the menu in the top right corner

     * This is a HACK and contrary to what Google suggests in the Compatibility section
     * of the Android Design Guidelines, 
     * 
     * http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/compatibility.html
     * 
     * "Android phones with traditional navigation hardware keys don't display the
     * virtual navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. Instead, the action overflow
     * is available from the menu hardware key. The resulting actions popup has the same
     * style as in the previous example, but is displayed at the bottom of the screen."
     * 
     * In Google's Android Developers blog they have a post titled, "Say Goodbye to the
     * Menu Button",
     * 
     * http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/01/say-goodbye-to-menu-button.html
     * 
     * where they tell developers that apps should stop relying on the hardware Menu
     * button and they should stop thinking about activities using a "menu button" at all.
     * Also, "In order to provide the most intuitive and consistent user experience in your
     * apps, you should migrate your designs away from using the Menu button and toward using
     * the action bar."
     * 
     * I believe it was a design mistake not have the menu button act as a redundant "action
     * overflow" button in menu button enabled devices. Having a consistent user experience
     * across all device configurations is a better way to transition the user away from
     * the hardware menu key.
